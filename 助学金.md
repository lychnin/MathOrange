My teacher and my friend highly recommend me to take this class.
this class will help me to improve my learning skills and through this class, I can use my time more effectively.
With this course, I will learn the foundations of deep learning by python. and I will understand the major technology trends driving Deep Learning
In the process of my studying, I realize that my learning method is not systematic, I always change my way to learn so that my efficient is very low.
So I want that this class will help me to improve these circumstances

I am a undergraduated student at Technology of Taiyuan University which located in China,I'm so sorry I'm too poor to afford the cost in China.All my income is just enough to cover my living expense, so I don’t have extra money to register the class. Furthermore, I want to save money for my family Since my parents have been working so hard to support me.For nowadays ，deep learning is so hot not only in China but also in the world.I request Coursera for financial aid, and I promise I will finish the course in time. I think Coursera is a very good platform for people to learn something they need, and sincerely hoping to learn something. This program provided by Coursera is a great opportunity for a poor student like me to pursue the course, and I hope I can get the chance. Thank you for your consideration. I hope you can agree with my application. I look forward to your reply.
Thank you so much
